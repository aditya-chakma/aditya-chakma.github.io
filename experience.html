                                <p class="details">
                                    Spanning Tree of a graph is a tree where all nodes are connected. A graph might have
                                    multiple spanning tree. A maximum leaves spanning tree (MLST) is a tree whose number
                                    of leaves is maximum. Finding MLST of a graph is a NP-hard problem. It is also
                                    APX-hard, which means it's approximation ratio is bounded by a constant. By finding
                                    the MLST of a network, we can find the backbone of the network, which can be used to
                                    refuce cost of the network. In this work, we tried to find an approximate algorithm
                                    for the MLST of a graph. We provide a heuristic algorithm following bottom-up
                                    approach.

                                    The Chakma language is a endangered language spoken by the Chakma people from
                                    Bangladesh. Not so many resources are available in Chakma language. Here we
                                    introduce a novel multilabel dataset for the Chakma language. The dataset contains
                                    111,382 handwritten character images. We also introduce a novel data collection
                                    method and provide a baseline model and provide statistics, comparing with the
                                    state-of-the-art models. We provide a novel pipeline for handwritten character
                                    recognition. First we convert handwritten characters to font type images using GAN,
                                    then we use a Visual Transformer based model for classification.

                                    In this work we introduce a novel bilingual and monolingual corpus for the Chakma
                                    language. The dataset consists of 13,000 sentences, collected from various ources
                                    including online crowd sourcing. We then expriment with NMT and SMT.

                                    In this work we have curated a dataset from various sources. Then reverse engineered
                                    the APKs to for source code analysing using APKtool for decompiling. We made a code
                                    parser and extracted import, method invocation and parameter based features from the
                                    source code. Afterwords, recursive feature enimilation and PCA was used for feature
                                    reduction. Then we ran tree based models for classification of benign and malicious
                                    apps. We ran feature importance on the collected dataset and found that, method
                                    invocation based featuers are the most important features.
